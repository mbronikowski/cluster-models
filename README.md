# cluster-models

Welcome to the cluster-models database!

[The project wiki (link)](https://github.com/mbronikowski/cluster-models/wiki) is the primary database of the project. The primary goal of the wiki is to create a comprehensive database of galaxy cluster lens models and modelling efforts in one place, along with availability information, download links and additional data. We highly encourage model authors to link their work on the clusters' pages, along with comments and model availability information.

The main repository will contain additional useful scripts and tutorials.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a work in progress. Please be patient with the development, and feel free to email the project author with ideas or feedback.
